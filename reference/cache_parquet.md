# Cache a Parquet Export of a Hugging Face Dataset

Downloads and caches the Parquet files for a dataset hosted on the
Hugging Face Hub, using the auto-generated `refs/convert/parquet`
branch. This branch contains a Parquet conversion of the dataset that
Hugging Face maintains automatically, which avoids the need to load the
dataset via its original (often script-based) loading format.

## Usage

``` r
cache_parquet(
  repo_id,
  config,
  split = NULL,
  revision = "refs%2Fconvert%2Fparquet",
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- repo_id:

  Character string. The repository ID of the dataset on the Hugging Face
  Hub, in the form `"user_id/repo_name"` (e.g.
  `"fancyzhx/amazon_polarity"`).

- config:

  Character string. The dataset configuration name. Many datasets expose
  only one configuration, in which case `"default"` can usually be used.
  If unsure, inspect the repository's `refs/convert/parquet` branch on
  the Hub to see the available configuration folders.

- split:

  Character string. The dataset split to cache, such as `"train"`,
  `"test"`, or `"validation"`. If `NULL` (default), all available splits
  for the given configuration are cached.

- revision:

  Character string. A specific commit hash to pin the download to,
  instead of using the latest revision of the `refs/convert/parquet`
  branch. Defaults to `NULL`, which resolves to the most recent commit.

- ...:

  Additional arguments, reserved for future use.

## Value

A named `list` with one entry per cached split. Each entry is a
character vector of local file paths to the cached Parquet shard(s) for
that split (a single path if the split has one shard, multiple paths if
it was sharded across several files).

## Details

Files are downloaded from the `refs/convert/parquet` branch maintained
by Hugging Face, not from the dataset's default branch. Large datasets
may be split across multiple Parquet shards; all matching shards for the
requested split are downloaded and cached.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # interactive()
cache_parquet(
  repo_id = "scikit-learn/iris",
  config  = "default"
)

cache_parquet(
  repo_id = "fancyzhx/amazon_polarity",
  config  = "amazon_polarity",
  split   = "train"
)
}
```
